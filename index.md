### CPSC 120

* Lab 4 Part 2

    This lab was one of my favorite labs because of the if statements. It was one of the first statememnts I learnt and felt fun.
    It was also easy and the high low game was fun because we got to guess numbers if it is right or wrong.

* Lab 8, part 2

    This lab is my favorite lab because I learnt how to play poker. In the future I will learn how to gamble and beat other people.
    My program is good that real people don't realize they are playing against a bot.

* Lab 9, part 1

    This lab is one of my favorites because we got to calculate the average group of numbers and the mean. 
    My partner and I really liked working together on this lab because it was so easy for the both of us. 
    We were able to split the workload and complete it with ease.
